Python Face Detector:-
This is a simple face detection application built using OpenCV in Python. The application uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time video streams.
Features
•	Real-time face detection from video files or webcam.
•	Draws rectangles around detected faces.
Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have the following installed:
•	Python 3.x
•	OpenCV library
You can install OpenCV using pip:

pip install opencv-python
Getting Started
1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-face-detector.git
cd python-face-detector
2.	Download Haar Cascade file:
You need the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file. You can download it from the OpenCV repository:
Haar Cascade Classifier
Place the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file in the same directory as your Python script.
3.	Choose a Video File:
You can use any video file for testing. Update the path in the code to point to your video file:

webcam = cv2.VideoCapture(r'C:\path\to\your\video.mp4')
4.	Run the Application:
Execute the script:
python face_detector.py
5.	Stop the Detection:
Press Q or q to exit the application.
Code Explanation
Here's a breakdown of the code used in the application:

import cv2  # Import the OpenCV library for computer vision tasks

# Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection
trained_face_data = cv2.CascadeClassifier('haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml')

# Open a video file or webcam feed for face detection
webcam = cv2.VideoCapture(r'C:\path\to\your\video.mp4')

while True:
    # Read a frame from the video feed
    successful_frame_read, frame = webcam.read()
    
    # Convert the frame to grayscale for easier face detection
    grayscaled_image = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
    
    # Detect faces in the grayscaled image
    face_coordinates = trained_face_data.detectMultiScale(grayscaled_image)
    
    # Draw rectangles around detected faces
    for (x, y, w, h) in face_coordinates:
        cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (0, 256, 0), 10)
    
    # Display the frame with rectangles around detected faces
    cv2.imshow('Face Detector', frame)
    
    # Wait for a key press and check if it is 'Q' or 'q' to exit
    key = cv2.waitKey(1)
    
    if key == 81 or key == 113:  # ASCII codes for 'Q' and 'q'
        break  # Exit the loop
Code Comments Explained
•	Importing Libraries: The cv2 library is imported to utilize its computer vision functionalities.

•	Loading the Haar Cascade Classifier: The CascadeClassifier is initialized with the Haar Cascade XML file to detect faces.

•	Setting Up Video Capture: The VideoCapture function opens the specified video file for processing.

•	Reading Frames in a Loop: A while loop continuously reads frames from the video.

•	Converting Frame to Grayscale: The cvtColor function converts the frame to grayscale to improve face detection accuracy.

•	Detecting Faces: The detectMultiScale method identifies faces in the grayscale image, returning their coordinates.

•	Drawing Rectangles Around Detected Faces: For each detected face, a rectangle is drawn on the original frame to highlight it.

•	Displaying the Video Stream: The imshow function displays the current frame with detected faces.

•	Exiting the Loop: The program checks for a key press to break the loop and stop detection.
